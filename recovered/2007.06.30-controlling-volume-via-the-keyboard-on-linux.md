<p>I was using Amarok’s global keyboard shortcuts to control the volume of my music via the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071126085017/http://pfuca-store.stores.yahoo.net/haphackeylit1.html">keyboard</a> but I wanted to control the system volume as well. A quick script later and now I can control both, and thanks to libnotify I get some feedback on what happened. It’s not as pretty as <span class="caps">OS X</span>’s volume control or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071126085017/http://growl.info/">Growl</a> but it’ll certainly do.</p>

	<p>I save this as <strong>~/bin/volume</strong> and call it thusly: <code>volume +</code> and <code>volume -</code>. I bind Alt-+ and Alt—to those in my fluxbox config. If you don’t have a preferred key binding program I recommend trying <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071126085017/http://hocwp.free.fr/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html">xbindkeys</a>. apt-get install, emerge, paludis -i, or rpm -i as needed.</p>

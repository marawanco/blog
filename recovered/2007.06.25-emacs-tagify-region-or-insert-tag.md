<p>After <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820114944/http://sami.samhuri.net/2007/6/26/rtfm">axing</a> half of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820114944/http://sami.samhuri.net/2007/6/23/emacs-for-textmate-junkies">wrap-region.el</a> I renamed it to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820114944/http://sami.samhuri.net/assets/2007/6/26/tagify.el">tagify.el</a> and improved it ever so slightly. It’s leaner, and does more!</p>


	<p><code>tagify-region-or-insert-tag</code> does the same thing as <code>wrap-region-with-tag</code> except if there is no region it now inserts the opening and closing tags and sets point in between them. I have this bound to <code>C-z t</code>, as I use <code>C-z</code> as my personal command prefix.</p>


	<p><code>&lt;</code> is bound to <code>tagify-region-or-insert-self</code> which really doesn’t warrant an explanation.</p>

<p>I cannot wait to try out <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820115032/http://rushcheck.rubyforge.org/about.html">RushCheck</a>. It is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820115032/http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/">QuickCheck</a> for Ruby. I don’t have experience with QuickCheck or anything but it’s clear to see how this helps you make certain your code is robust.</p>

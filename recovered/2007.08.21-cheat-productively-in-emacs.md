<p>By now you may have heard about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820114625/http://cheat.errtheblog.com/">cheat</a>, the command line cheat sheet collection that’s completely open to editing, wiki style.  A couple of weeks ago I posted <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820114625/http://sami.samhuri.net/2007/8/10/cheat-from-emacs">cheat.el</a> which allows one to cheat from within Emacs.  There’s an update.  However, before I get to cheat.el there’s a small detour.</p>


	<p>Cheat is not just about Ruby!  A few examples of cheats available are:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>bash and zsh</li>
		<li>$EDITOR (if you happen to like e, TextMate, vi, emacs, RadRails, ...)</li>
		<li><span class="caps">GNU</span> screen</li>
		<li>Version control (darcs, svn, git)</li>
		<li>Firebug</li>
		<li>Markdown and Textile</li>
		<li>Oracle and MySQL</li>
		<li>Regular expressions</li>
		<li>and of course Ruby, Rails, Capistrano, etc.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>As of today, Aug-21 2007, the count is at <strong>166 cheat sheets</strong> so there’s probably something there that you’ll want to look up from the command line or Emacs sometime.  That’s enough stroking cheat’s ego, but there seems to be a notion that cheat is only for Ruby stuff and that’s really not the case.</p>


	<p>So what’s new in this version of cheat.el?  <strong>Completion!</strong>  The only thing that bothered me about cheating in Emacs was the lack of completion.  It now has completion, thus it is now perfect. :)  In all likeliness this won’t be the last release, but I can’t really foresee adding anything else to it in the near future.  Enjoy!</p>

	<p>For any newcomers, just drop this into <code>~/.emacs.d</code>, <code>~/.elisp</code>, or any directory in your <code>load-path</code> and then <code>(require 'cheat)</code>.

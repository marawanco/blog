  <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070316171948/http://www.apple.com/itunes/jukebox/coverflow.html">Cover Flow</a> now comes in a full-screen flavour. It’s pretty sweet, but unfortunately the remote controls iTunes exactly the same so you need a mouse to flick through the covers.</p>


	<p>That made me wonder if Front Row used this full-screen Cover Flow view for albums now, but it doesn’t. I hope Apple gets on this and adds it to Front Row and the Apple TV. I’m sure it’s already on their list.</p>


	<p>I would love to be able to flick through my albums with the remote right now, but I’m not going to install one of those 3rd-party remote config tools. Guess I have to wait for Apple to do it.</p>

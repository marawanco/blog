  <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060614130628/http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> released the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060614130628/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303411"><span class="caps">OS X 10</span>.4.6 update</a> which fixed a <strong>really</strong> annoying bug for me. Terminal (and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060614130628/http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a>) would fail to open a new window/tab when your shell is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060614130628/http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">zsh</a>. iTerm would just open then immediately close the window, while Terminal would display the message: <code>[Command completed]</code> in a now-useless window.</p>


	<p>Rebooting twice to get the fix was reminiscent of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060614130628/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">Windows</a>, but well worth it.</p>

<p>I should read the Emacs manual sometime, especially since I have it in dead-tree form. Check out <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071112190135/http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/autotype/Inserting-Pairs.html">skeleton pairs</a> in the Emacs manual, or better yet <code>C-h f skeleton-pair-insert-maybe</code>. skeleton-pair has already been massaged to do what you most likely want if you set the correct options. Cool. I like Emacs more every day.</p>


	<p>This renders <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071112190135/http://sami.samhuri.net/2007/6/23/emacs-for-textmate-junkies">wrap-region</a> useless, which is great! I like a trim .emacs and .emacs.d.</p>

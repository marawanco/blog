I&#8217;d just like to say, <a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9717828-7.html">bwa ha ha ha!</a>

Summary: Paris Hilton drove with a suspended license and is facing 45 days in jail. Now she&#8217;s reaching out to lord knows who on her MySpace page to petition The Governator to pardon her. I might cry if I weren&#8217;t pissing myself laughing.

Paris Hilton is out of her mind, living in some fantasy world separate from Earth. Pathetic doesn&#8217;t begin to describe this plea for help from her own stupidity. She knowingly and willingly disobeyed the law, got busted, and then proceeded to claim that:

> *&#8220;She provides hope for young people all over the U.S. <strong>and the world</strong>. She provides beauty and excitement to (most of) our <strong>otherwise mundane</strong> lives.&#8221;*

I take this as a learning experience. For example, I learned that the US is no longer part of the world.

Flat out crazy, insane, not of sound mind. She is not any sort of hope, inspiration or role model for anyone.

>=A0On the other hand, watch this video. Even in Mozilla=92s own demo =97 w=
hich presumably puts Firefox for Android in its best light =97doesn=92t the=
 whole thing look a bit herky-jerky, in terms of touch responsiveness and s=
crolling smoothness?

Surely they could do better on iOS though. I have faith in the Firefox

past. Modern versions of Firefox are excellent.

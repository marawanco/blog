<p>This time I’ve got a few snippets for assertions. Using these to type up your tests quickly, and then hitting <strong>⌘R</strong> to run the tests without leaving TextMate, makes testing your Rails app that much more convenient. Just when you thought it was already too easy! (Don’t forget that you can use <strong>⌥⌘↓</strong> to move between your code and the corresponding test case.)</p>

<p>This time I’m posting the .plist files to make it easier for you to add them to TextMate. All you need to do is copy these to <strong>~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/Rails.tmbundle/Snippets</strong>.</p>

<p>If anyone would rather I list them all here I can do that as well. Just leave a comment.</p>

<p><em>(I wanted to include a droplet in the zip file that will copy the snippets to the right place, but my 3-hour attempt at writing the AppleScript to do so left me feeling quite bitter. Maybe I was just mistaken in thinking it would be easy to pick up AppleScript.)</em></p>
